# Running Up That Hill üèîÔ∏è

A interactive journey simulator inspired by themes of empathy, understanding, and the challenges we overcome when trying to see things from another person's perspective.

## About

This project explores the metaphorical concept of "running up that hill" - the journey two people take to better understand each other. Through shared experiences, listening, and mutual support, understanding grows and connections deepen.

## Features

- **Interactive Python CLI**: A command-line experience with both automated and interactive modes
- **Web Interface**: A visual HTML/JavaScript version with animated hill climbing
- **Themes of Empathy**: Focus on understanding, listening, and mutual support
- **Progress Tracking**: Watch as understanding grows through the journey

## How to Use

### Python Version
Run the Python script for a text-based interactive experience:

```bash
python3 running_up_that_hill.py
```

Choose from:
1. **Simulated Journey**: Watch two characters automatically progress up the hill
2. **Interactive Mode**: Make choices that affect the journey and understanding
3. **Exit**: End the program

### Web Version
Open `index.html` in your web browser for a visual experience:

- Click "Begin the Journey" to start
- Use "Take a Step Together" to make progress
- Use "Pause and Listen" to focus on understanding
- Watch the visual progress on the hill and understanding meter

## The Journey

The core concept revolves around two people (or perspectives) trying to understand each other by:

- **Taking steps together**: Making progress through shared experience
- **Listening**: Pausing to truly hear and understand each other
- **Supporting each other**: Helping when energy is low
- **Building understanding**: Growing empathy and connection over time

## Technical Details

- **Python Requirements**: Python 3.6+ (uses only standard library)
- **Web Requirements**: Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- **No Dependencies**: Both versions are self-contained

## Running the Project

### Python CLI Version
```bash
# Make the script executable (optional)
chmod +x running_up_that_hill.py

# Run the program
python3 running_up_that_hill.py
```

### Web Version
Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No server required.

## Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from themes of empathy, understanding, and the universal human desire to connect with others despite our differences. The "hill" represents the challenges we face in truly understanding another person's perspective, and the journey represents the effort required to build meaningful connections.
